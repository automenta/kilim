 * booleans, indexed by the local variable number. Since it is <i>very</i> rare for a method to have
 * more than 31 local variables, the vectors are represented by int bitmaps. For more than this, the
 * basic block creates an instance of BigUsage that is functionally identical (TODO)
 * 
 * Note that we don't need to track usage of operand stack. All elements of the operand stack are
 * always live, and always need to be stored and restored (during stack switching). This is not true
 * of local vars; a var may have a valid value which may not be used downstream, so we track which
 * vars must be taken seriously.
